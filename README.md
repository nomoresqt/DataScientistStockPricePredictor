# Udacity Data Scientist Capston Project Stock Predictor


This project is the capstone project of Udacity Data Scientist nano-degree. For this project, I built a model to predict stock prices. 

My personal professional background is in Finance and Investments. One of the reasons why I’m learning Data Science is to utility this powerful tool in the financial sector. The modern  

Financial sectors consumers and generate enormous amount of date on daily basis. More than 90% of the daily trading volume of the major stock exchanges are conducted by computer program and algorithms. Machine learning and deep learning has become an essential tool for automate complicated trading decision making and trade execution process.  

In this project, I’m using LSTM model to predict stocks/ asset price a day in the future. Long short-term memory model( LSTM) is a RNN ( Recurrent Neural Network) architecture.

LSTMs are extremely effective tool for sequence prediction problems. Since LTSM has feedback connection, it’s good at processing sequential of data, such as : historical stock prices.
